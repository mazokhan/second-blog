            <p>This was a very interesting project where we were required to essentially find an API and create the json server for the information to be passed through.</p> <br>
                In the start i was a little lost as i wasnt sure what theme i should be go for, I initially decided a movie database however the movie api only consisted data about songs!.<br> 
                The coint API that i found is https://www.coingecko.com/en/en. <p><br> The only thing i couldn't figure out was after adding the coin how do i update it to the main table as opposed to the 
                table that i created. I tried several different ways but eventually gave up!.<p><br> I also watched a lot of youtube videos to better understand DOM and the structure that are followed.
                It was interesting to learn some old methods as well such as innerTEXT and now we use inner.HTML. Also trying to understand the developer toold side of things, such as child and parent nodes.
                I kept searching for something interesting that is relevant and new wanting to keep it simple at the same time. There were times i wanted to smash my computer!!!.</p>
                .<br>

    <p>At first this project looked like a huge mountain to climb. I was initially still a little confused with DOM. <br>
     I went throught the lecture recordings and also of the one where my lecturer did a mock assignment and to better understand the structure.<br>
     I decided the theme for my project the topic of cryptocurrency as i have a strong interest in this sector. I found an api that lists the cryptocurrenices and i created 
     bascially a form where we can add a picture and details of the crypto into that. This is done by using the post method to add data directly into the page which then gets added to db json.</p><br>

     We can also add a photo along with other information about the coin.This is essentialy being able to add coins to the database which in turn fetches the data from db json to be displayed on the page.<br>
     <p>The interesting part of this project was to understand how the functions work together to form the repsonses for the information to be displayed.I had plenty of problems with my local host
    not woking and then i somehow managed to get the local host to display the website.</p> <br>
    <p> I added css which a lot of it i found on google and youtube as i have been learning some tips and tricks to make pretty websites.
    I am not that skilled with bootstrap, however i used bootstrap for the buttons part. I will learn how to use bootstrap a lot more detail in the future.  </p>
