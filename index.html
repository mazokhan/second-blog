            <p>This was a fun and straightforward projet where we required to do build ruby rails project.</p> <br>
                I decided t build a weather app with a weather API that i found on github - Which was quite interesting and fun to do. I initially decided a movie database however the movie api only consisted data about songs!.<br> 
                The whole part of this project was to find random information about Dogs.  <p><br> The user just has to put in the city's weather they are searching for and it will display the relevant weather information<p><br> This was different to the ruby project as that was just a backend and kept simple with a series of questions. 
                i used javascript and ruby for tha backend as this is what i know best.

    <p>Although Ruby language is on a decline, a lot of of start ups use ruby when building thier applications <br>
     Ruby is more backend and is interesting to see how it all comes together.<br> scraping concept for me was a new one and quite interesting. 
     I would like to make a website for music events in the sydney area using a scraper. My preffrerd language is python, which is a very easy and fun to use language.</p><br>

     Being able to ask questions and go back and forth with the api was an interesting way of relaying information back and forth.<br>
     <p>The interesting part of this project was to understand how the functions work together to form the repsonses for the information to be displayed.<br>
