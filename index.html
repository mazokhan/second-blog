            <p>This was a very interesting project where we were required to essentially find an API and be able to ask questions and respond to get information back.</p> <br>
                I ended up finding a 'Dog Facts' API - Which was quite interesting and fun to do. I initially decided a movie database however the movie api only consisted data about songs!.<br> 
                The whole part of this project was to find random information about Dogs.  <p><br> The first question that comes up is 'How Many dog facts do you want?'. This is where you can choose how many you want and the limit is upto 100.<p><br> Then a question is asked 'Do you want them in random order?'
                And that is a simple Y/N option. The next question followed up is 'Do you want to know more facts?' - Which again is a yes or no answer.
                The Gemfile used for scraping is Mechanize. This is how i was able to get the information back from the API.</p>
                .<br>

    <p>Although Ruby language is on a decline, a lot of of start ups use ruby when building thier applications <br>
     Ruby is more backend and is interesting to see how it all comes together.<br> scraping concept for me was a new one and quite interesting. 
     I would like to make a website for music events in the sydney area using a scraper. My preffrerd language is python, which is a very easy and fun to use language.</p><br>

     Being able to ask questions and go back and forth with the api was an interesting way of relaying information back and forth.<br>
     <p>The interesting part of this project was to understand how the functions work together to form the repsonses for the information to be displayed.<br>
